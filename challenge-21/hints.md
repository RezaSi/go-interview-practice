# Hints for Binary Search

## Hint 1: Algorithm Choice
This problem requires searching in a sorted array. Think about algorithms that can take advantage of the sorted property to search more efficiently than linear search.

## Hint 2: Divide and Conquer
Binary search uses a divide-and-conquer approach. In each step, you eliminate half of the remaining search space.

## Hint 3: Middle Element Strategy
Start by looking at the middle element of the array. Compare it with your target value to decide which half of the array to search next.

## Hint 4: Pointer Management
Use two pointers: `left` and `right` to track the current search boundaries. Update these pointers based on your comparison with the middle element.

## Hint 5: Loop Condition
Continue searching while `left <= right`. When this condition becomes false, the element is not in the array.

## Hint 6: Avoiding Integer Overflow
When calculating the middle index, use `left + (right - left) / 2` instead of `(left + right) / 2` to avoid potential integer overflow.

## Hint 7: Return Values
Return the index if the element is found, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
