# Hints for Challenge 24: Dynamic Programming - Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Hint 1: Understanding the DP State
The key insight is defining what `dp[i]` represents:
- `dp[i]` = length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`
- Every single element forms a subsequence of length 1
- Base case: initialize all `dp[i] = 1`

```go
dp := make([]int, len(nums))
for i := range dp {
    dp[i] = 1  // Every element is a subsequence of length 1
}
```

## Hint 2: DP Transition Logic
For each position `i`, check all previous positions `j`:
- If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, we can extend the subsequence ending at `j`
- Update: `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`
- Time complexity: O(n²) due to nested loops

```go
for i := 1; i < len(nums); i++ {
    for j := 0; j < i; j++ {
        if nums[j] < nums[i] {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        }
    }
}
```

## Hint 3: Optimized Approach with Binary Search
The O(n²) approach can be optimized to O(n log n) using a "tails" array:
- `tails[i]` stores the smallest ending element of all subsequences of length `i+1`
- For each number, use binary search to find where it should be placed
- This maintains the invariant that `tails` is always sorted

```go
tails := []int{}
for _, num := range nums {
    pos := sort.SearchInts(tails, num)
    if pos == len(tails) {
        tails = append(tails, num)  // Extend the sequence
    } else {
        tails[pos] = num  // Replace with smaller ending element
    }
}
```

## Hint 4: Reconstructing the Actual Sequence
To get the actual LIS elements (not just length):
- Keep a `parent` array to track the previous element in the sequence
- During DP, when updating `dp[i]`, also set `parent[i] = j`
- After DP, find the position with maximum length and backtrack

```go
parent := make([]int, len(nums))
// During DP: if updating dp[i], set parent[i] = j

// Reconstruction: start from maxIndex and follow parent pointers
current := maxIndex
for i := maxLength - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
    lis[i] = nums[current]
    current = parent[current]
}
```

## Key LIS Concepts:
- **Dynamic Programming**: Build solution from smaller subproblems using optimal substructure
- **Binary Search**: Use sorted array to find insertion position efficiently (O(log n))
- **Tails Array**: Maintains smallest tail for each possible LIS length, enabling optimization
- **Reconstruction**: Use parent pointers to build actual sequence, not just calculate length
