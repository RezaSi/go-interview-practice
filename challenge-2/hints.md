# Hints for Reverse a String

## Hint 1: Understanding the Problem
You need to reverse the order of characters in a string. Think about what "reverse" means - the first character becomes the last, the second becomes second-to-last, etc.

## Hint 2: String to Slice Conversion
In Go, strings are immutable. To manipulate them, you often need to convert them to a slice. Consider converting the string to `[]rune` to handle Unicode characters properly:
```go
runes := []rune(s)
```

## Hint 3: Two-Pointer Technique
A common approach is to use two pointers - one at the beginning and one at the end of the slice. Swap the characters at these positions and move the pointers toward each other.

## Hint 4: Loop Condition
Continue swapping until the two pointers meet in the middle. The condition should be something like `left < right`.

## Hint 5: Swapping Elements
Swap elements in Go using:
```go
runes[left], runes[right] = runes[right], runes[left]
```

## Hint 6: Converting Back
After reversing the slice of runes, convert it back to a string using `string(runes)`.

## Hint 7: Alternative Approach
You could also build the reversed string by iterating through the original string backwards and building a new string with each character.
