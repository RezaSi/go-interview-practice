# Learning: Production Logging Patterns

## **What is a Logging Pipeline?**

In development, we often just `fmt.Println` or log to the console.  
In production, logs aren’t just messages—they are **real-time data streams**.  

A **logging pipeline** processes and routes log events to multiple destinations, each with different purposes:
- Live monitoring (console)
- Persistent storage (log file)
- Critical alerting (hook/stream)

---

## **The Log Pipeline Concept**

Think of logs like items on a factory conveyor belt:

- **Live Monitoring (Console)**  
  Human-readable logs for developers watching the system in real-time.  
  Uses `TextFormatter`.  

- **Inventory & Archiving (Log File)**  
  Every event is archived in a structured format for future analysis.  
  Uses `JSONFormatter`.  

- **Quality Control & Alerts (Hook)**  
  Only *critical defects* (warnings & errors) are routed for immediate action.  
  Custom `RetryHook` writes filtered logs to `stderr`.

## **io.MultiWriter: The Splitter Valve**

How do you log to multiple outputs without duplicating code?  
Go’s standard library provides `io.MultiWriter`.

```go
// Open a log file for appending
logFile, err := os.OpenFile("app.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("failed to open log file: %v", err)
}

// Create a multi-writer: logs go to both stdout and the file
multiWriter := io.MultiWriter(os.Stdout, logFile)

// Configure logrus with the multi-writer
logger := logrus.New()
logger.SetOutput(multiWriter)
logger.SetFormatter(&logrus.TextFormatter{})

// A single call logs to console and file
logger.Info("Worker started")
````

Now a single `logger.Info(...)` call appears **both on screen and in `app.log`**.

---

## **Custom RetryHook Example**

A **hook** allows you to intercept log entries and route them elsewhere.
Here’s a minimal `RetryHook` that forwards `Warn` and `Error` logs to `stderr` as JSON:

```go
type RetryHook struct {
    Out       io.Writer
    Formatter logrus.Formatter
}

func (h *RetryHook) Levels() []logrus.Level {
    return []logrus.Level{logrus.WarnLevel, logrus.ErrorLevel}
}

func (h *RetryHook) Fire(entry *logrus.Entry) error {
    // Format the entry as JSON
    line, err := h.Formatter.Format(entry)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    _, err = h.Out.Write(line)
    return err
}

// Usage
func main() {
    logger := logrus.New()
    logger.SetOutput(os.Stdout)
    logger.SetFormatter(&logrus.TextFormatter{})

    // Attach the RetryHook
    hook := &RetryHook{
        Out:       os.Stderr,
        Formatter: &logrus.JSONFormatter{},
    }
    logger.AddHook(hook)

    logger.Info("Normal info log (console only)")
    logger.Warn("Retry attempt failed (also goes to stderr as JSON)")
    logger.Error("Task permanently failed (also goes to stderr as JSON)")
}
```

**Output:**

Console (`stdout` - text):

```
INFO[0000] Normal info log (console only)
WARN[0000] Retry attempt failed (also goes to stderr as JSON)
ERRO[0000] Task permanently failed (also goes to stderr as JSON)
```

Alerting stream (`stderr` - JSON):

```json
{"level":"warning","msg":"Retry attempt failed (also goes to stderr as JSON)","time":"..."}
{"level":"error","msg":"Task permanently failed (also goes to stderr as JSON)","time":"..."}
```

## **Centralized Logging**

In production, you often run multiple servers or microservices.
SSH’ing into each machine to tail log files is a nightmare.
Solution: **centralized logging**.

### The ELK Stack

* **Elasticsearch** → Stores & indexes logs for fast search
* **Logstash** → Processes & ships logs to Elasticsearch
* **Kibana** → Visualizes logs in dashboards

Your structured JSON logs (`app.log`) integrate perfectly with this pipeline.
A tool like **Filebeat** ships new log entries to ELK in real time.

---

## **Best Practices for Microservice Logging**

1. **Log in JSON (always)** → structured, parseable
2. **Log to stdout/stderr** in containers → integrates with Docker/Kubernetes logging drivers
3. **Use Correlation IDs** → trace requests across services
4. **Enrich logs with metadata** (service, env, version, host)
5. **Treat logs as an API** → field names are contracts, don’t rename casually

## **Key Takeaways**

* Logs are data streams, not debug prints.
* Use **multi-destination logging** (console + file + alerts).
* **Structured JSON logs** fuel centralized logging systems.
* Hooks give you **separate error/alerting channels**.
* Logging is an **operational contract**—treat it like an API.
