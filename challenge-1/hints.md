# Hints for Sum of Two Numbers

## Hint 1: Function Signature
Look at the required function signature: `func Sum(a int, b int) int`. You need to take two integer parameters and return one integer.

## Hint 2: Basic Arithmetic
This challenge requires the simplest arithmetic operation. You need to add the two input numbers together.

## Hint 3: Return Statement
Use the `return` keyword to return the result. You can either store the sum in a variable first, or return the calculation directly.

## Hint 4: One-Line Solution
This can be solved in a single line:
```go
return a + b
```
